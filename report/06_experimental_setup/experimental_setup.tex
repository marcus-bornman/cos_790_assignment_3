\section{Experimental Setup}
Firstly, the parameter values for the genetic programming approach have been mentioned throughout the preceding sections. However, for reference, they are summarized with the rest of the parameters below:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Population Size = 256
    \item Tournament Size = 16
    \item Crossover Rate = 0.8
    \item Mutation Rate = 0.1
    \item Reproduction Rate = 0.1
    \item Max Initial Depth = 4
    \item Max offspring Depth = 20
    \item Max Mutation Depth = 4
    \item Num. Generations = 128
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

In addition, as has been mentioned, instances in the Travelling Salesman Problem Library \cite{reinelt1991tsplib} were used for experimentation. The specific instances used comprised small, medium and large problems of which 5 were symmetric and 5 were asymmetric problems. The symmetric problems were \emph{ch150}, \emph{eil51}, \emph{eil101}, \emph{rat195} and \emph{rd400}. The symmetric problems were \emph{ftv170}, \emph{rbg323}, \emph{rbg358}, \emph{rbg403} and \emph{rbg443}.

Finally, the machine used for development and testing purposes was a 2015 15-inch Macbook Pro with a 2.5 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of memory and 500GB of storage. At the time of experimentation the machine had a battery cycle count of 684.
