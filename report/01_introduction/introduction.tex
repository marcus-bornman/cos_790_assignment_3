\section{Introduction}
This assignment involves implementation of a generation constructive hyper-
heuristics to create heuristics for the symmetric and asymmetric Travel-
ling Salesman Problem (TSP). More specifically, the toolset provided by ECJ \cite{pillay2017evohyp} - a Java toolkit for evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics - was used to construct a genetic programming approach to generate and evolve a population of parse trees for prioritizing routes for travelling salesman problems in the Travelling Salesman Problem Library \cite{reinelt1991tsplib}. All of the code that was used to employ the genetic algorithm can be found on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/marcus-bornman/cos_790_assignment_3}. The repository also contains all information necessary to reproduce the results that are discussed in this assignment.
